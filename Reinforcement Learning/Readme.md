This folder contains different projects on OpenAI Gym environments using Reinforcement Learning concepts. Here, the library "Stable baselines3" is used to get the algorithms: 
- Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO)
- Deep Q Learning Network (DQN)
- Actor Critic (A2C)
The process involved utilising environments: CartPolev0 and CarRacingv0 to understand the required actions and possible states in the environment. 
OS library was used to save the models with different timesteps to check accuracy of the learner after learning for a longer time duration.
