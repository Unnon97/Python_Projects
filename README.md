Projects to learn Deep Learning concepts using Python implementation using datasets from Kaggle.

Topics for projects involve:
- Using CNN on Sign Language images to identify alphabets of the language(Supervised learning classification)
- Using AutoEncoder Networks to colorize gray images by finding the latent space of image data
- Using LSTM networks(Pytorch) on stock market dataset to predict updcoming prices
- Using LSTM network(Tensorflow) on Alcohol sales data to predict the sales value
